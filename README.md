## *Description* 

Build-a-Burger! is a Burger app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat or have already eaten.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the created burger will appear on the top section "Burgers that I will like to TRY!!!", unless the User selects the button "devoured" from the bottom section - where the Burger will then display from "Burgers that have been DEVOURED!".
If the User has already devoured a burger from the waiting to be tried section it will be added to the list.
The app stores every burger in a database, whether DEVOURED or not.
